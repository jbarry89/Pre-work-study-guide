# Pre-Work Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Study Guide was created for students who attended Web Development bootcamp. It contains notes on the subjects that were covered during the whole course. This includes; HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Creating this study guide will help students (even if they have no technical background) use these notes as building blocks to set them up for success and always be able to use it as a reference when stuck on project issue(s).
